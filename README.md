Encryption is a process for the protection of data by means of an encryption associated with a key so that the information is not visible, this with the aim of protecting the information of third parties that are not authorized to visualize, for this a symmetric algorithm is used of encryption called Hill Cipher (HC). The HC algorithm was perfectly adapted to the solution of the problem that already uses with a square matrix to encrypt the channels of the pixel of an image or the characters of a text. This is applied to an instant messaging application, thus preventing third parties from understanding the message. 
Objective:
  - Create a mobile application, similar like whatsapp and telegram free to install for anyone
  - Apply the cryptography algorithm Hill Cipher to all images and texts
  - All messages and pictures will be visible but will be incompressible until the user input the correct phrase
  - Create an easy to mount server using open source tools like mysql, python, linux, etc.


### Installation

You will need python, pypi and mysql.
Install the dependencies in the server, we are going to use virtualenv and python pip PyPi.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/mroctavious/iTochcrypt.git
$ cd iTochcrypt
$ chmod 755 install.sh
$ ./install.sh
```

### Development

Want to contribute? That would be great!
Right now, it is a school project but I think it's a great idea, that's why I want to keep working on it in my free time. You are welcome to join :D.

**Free Software, Hell Yeah!**
A very special THANKS is to M.S.I Fausto Abraham Jacques Docent from Universidad Autonoma de Queretaro, for being a sample for the university and and always looking for the wisdom and passion from the student.
Viva Mexico!
